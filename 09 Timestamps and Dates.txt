***Dates & Timestamps
# we can print todays timestamp using NOW() function
-> SELECT NOW();
# timestamp is a combination of date and time
-> for printing the date only -> SELECT NOW()::DATE;
-> for printing the time only -> SELECT NOW()::TIME;

# postgresql have some documentations on date and time types.
https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-datetime.html


# we have already used the DATE type in our column


***Adding and Substracing Dates
# what if we want to substrac 1 year from now?
-> SELECT NOW() - INTERVAL '2 YEAR';
# here interval is a special keyword

# we can also substract months and days.
-> SELECT NOW() - INTERVAL '10 MONTH';
-> SELECT NOW() - INTERVAL '23 DAY';

# we can also add 
-> SELECT NOW() + INTERVAL '2 YEAR';
-> SELECT NOW() + INTERVAL '10 MONTH';
-> SELECT NOW() + INTERVAL '23 DAY';

#  we can also combine them
-> SELECT NOW() - INTERVAL '2 YEAR 10 MONTH 23 DAY';
-> SELECT NOW() + INTERVAL '2 YEAR 10 MONTH 23 DAY';

# if we want to see only date after add/sub 
-> SELECT (NOW() + INTERVAL '10 MONTH')::DATE;
-> SELECT (NOW() - INTERVAL '10 MONTH')::DATE;
# here the entire expression gives us a time stamp,
# so we have to wrap the whole expression.

# We can also do the same thing using HOUR, MINUTE and SECOND
-> SELECT NOW() + INTERVAL '2 HOUR';
-> SELECT NOW() - INTERVAL '2 MINUTE';
-> SELECT NOW() + INTERVAL '2 SECOND';


***Extracting Fields From Timestamp
# now we will extract specific values from timestamps
-> printing the year            -> SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM NOW());
-> printing the month           -> SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM NOW());
-> printing the day             -> SELECT EXTRACT(DAY FROM NOW());
-> printing the Day of the week -> SELECT EXTRACT(DOW FROM NOW());   
-> printing the century         -> SELECT EXTRACT(CENTURY FROM NOW());   
-> printing the hour            -> SELECT EXTRACT(HOUR FROM NOW());
-> printing the minute          -> SELECT EXTRACT(MINUTE FROM NOW());
-> printing the second          -> SELECT EXTRACT(SECOND FROM NOW());



***AGE function
# what if we want to create an age column 
# we can use AGE() function, it takes two argument, current date and date_of_birth.
-> SELECT id, first_name, last_name, (AGE(NOW(), date_of_birth)) AS age FROM person ORDER by age DESC;
# we can also extract the specific fields from here.


***Cast a Timestamp or Interval to string
# we can do that by TO_CHAR() function.

# first lets select the timestamp
-> SELECT '2016-08-12 16:40:32'::TIMESTAMP;

# now lets convert it to a string
-> SELECT TO_CHAR('2016-08-12 16:40:32'::TIMESTAMP, 'DD Mon YYYY HH:MI:SSPM');
# here the second arguement is for the formatting
# DD -> Day number
# Mon -> month abbreviated
# YYYY -> 4 digit Year 
# HH -> hour
# MI -> minute
# SS -> SECOND
# PM -> AM or PM

# to see all the formatting we can go to this link:
"""https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-formatting.html"""

# we can format as we want
-> SELECT TO_CHAR('2016-08-12 16:40:32'::TIMESTAMP, '"Today is "FMDay", the "DDth" day of the month of "FMMonth" of "YYYY');
