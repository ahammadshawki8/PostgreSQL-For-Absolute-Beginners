***Coalesce
# it allows us to have a default value incase the first one is not present
-> SELECT COALESCE(1) AS number;
# what if we have the first value of coalesce null?
-> SELECT COALESCE(null, 1) AS number;
# it gives the default value 1

# we can also have multiple param
# if the first is not present, if that one isn't present try second, if that not, try third.....
-> SELECT COALESCE(null, null, 1) AS number;
-> SELECT COALESCE(null, 5, 1) AS number;

# Lets say we want to enter a value 'EMAIL NOT PROVIDED' for those people who don't have email
-> SELECT id, first_name, last_name, COALESCE(email, 'EMAIL NOT PROVIDED') AS email FROM person;

# coalesce is very powerful tool. 
# All arguements in the COALESCE() must be of same datatype.



***Nullif
# what if we want to divide something by 0
-> SELECT 10 / 0; 
# we get an error [ERROR:  division by zero]

# we can tackle this with Nullif
# nullif takes two arguement,
# if the firts one is equl to second one, then it returns null
# else, the first one
-> SELECT NULLIF(10, 10);
-> SELECT NULLIF(10, 5);

# this can be very handy.
# because if we divide something by null, we won't get an error
-> SELECT 10 / null; 

# So, if we use 0 in the nullif as the second arguement
-> SELECT 10 / NULLIF(8, 0);
# in the place of 8 we can use any other number,
# but if we use 0, it wil return null
-> SELECT 10 / NULLIF(0, 0);

# we can mix those two commands
-> SELECT COALESCE(10 / NULLIF(0, 0), 0);
# this trick is useful when we need to change all the 0's of a specific column to another number.
