***Insert records
# we have to write the following command

INSERT INTO table_name (
	column_name
)
VALUES (value_of_column);


# So for our case -

INSERT INTO person (
	first_name,
	last_name,
	gender,
	date_of_birth
)
VALUES ('Anne', 'Smith', 'Female', '1988-01-09');

# If we dont want to add email then we can keep it null or don't mention it in the INSERT INTO.

INSERT INTO person (
	first_name,
	last_name,
	gender,
	date_of_birth,
	email
)
VALUES ('Java', 'Kale', 'Female', '1992-01-10', null);


# If we want to add email too then

INSERT INTO person (
	first_name,
	last_name,
	gender,
	date_of_birth,
	email
)
VALUES ('Ahammad', 'Shawki', 'Male', '2004-12-28', 'ahammadshawki8@gmail.com'); 

# we have to use single quotes for strings.
# we can see that the id(BIGSERIAL) is auto incrimented


# Lets insert a thousand more people to our table and also add a new column
# we are going to use the Mockaroo website
# we will open the .sql file with an ide
# we can see that here we have 1000 of data

***Opening File
-> opening the sql file in psql -> \i file_path

***Adding new column
-> currently creating the whole table again
