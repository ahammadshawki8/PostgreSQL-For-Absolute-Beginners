# when we are creating a database, by default we are copying the standard template named template1.
# there is another template in postgreSQL named template0,
# which gives us some more functionality over template1.
# one is here we can mention the encoding we want to like in our database.
-> creating database with encoding      -> CREATE DATABASE database_name WITH ENCODING = 'UTF8' TEMPLATE template0;

# For more details about templates in PostgreSQL visit
"""https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/manage-ag-templatedbs.html"""


*** Connect
	psql -h hostname -p port -U username -W password database_name
or, 
	run psql from the beginning
or, 
	\c database_name
#	\c means connect

***Delete
-> deleting database -> DROP DATABASE database_name;
-> deleting database if it exists -> DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS database_name;

NOTE: If we REALLY want to delete our database, 
then we must should have a BACKUP for that data.
