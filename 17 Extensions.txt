***Extensions
# postgres is designed to be easily extensible.
# so, we can load extensions to tables like features which are built in.
# basically extensions are functions that can add extra functionality to our database.

# we can view the list of available database,
-> SELECT * FROM pg_available_extensions;
# we can see that we have 86 extensions here.
# we can see the extensions name, version and comment.
