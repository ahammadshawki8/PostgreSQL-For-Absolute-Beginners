***SELECT
-> select all rows -> SELECT * FROM table_name;
# * means everything

-> select any column -> SELECT column_name FROM table_name;
-> select multiple column -> SELECT column1_name, column2_name FROM table_name;



***Sort
# we are going to use ORDER BY command to sort our data
# we can sort our datain two orders
-> ascending -> ASC  [default]
-> descending -> DESC

# for sorting
-> SELECT * FROM table_name ORDER BY column_name as sorting_order;

# we can also combine multiple columns when we sort
-> SELECT * FROM table_name ORDER BY column1_name,column2_name as sorting_order;



***Distinct
# if we only select the country we can see that we have lots of duplicates
# But sometimes we just want to know the unique countries of the table.
# to do that we can,
-> SELECT DISTINCT column_name FROM table_name ORDER BY column_name as sorting_order;



***Where Clause and And and OR
-> criteria in column -> SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name = 'expected_data';
-> multiple criteria -> SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column1_name = 'expected_data1' AND column2_name = 'expected_data2';
# we can also use OR Clause

-> combining more than two criteria -> SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column1_name = 'expected_data1' AND (column2_name = 'expected_data2' OR column3_name = 'expected_data3');
# and so on ....



***Comparison Opertors
# if we do this command
-> SELECT 1 = 1;
# it will give us t (meaning TRUE)
# again
-> SELECT 1 = 2;
# it will give us f (meaning FALSE)
# we also have
-> != Not equal to   or   <> Not equal to
-> > Greater than
-> < Less than
-> >= Greater than or equal to
-> <= Less than or equal to
-> !> Not Greater Than 
-> !< Not Less Than 

# we can use this comparisons in not only int but all data types.
# casing matters in string

# We can use this operators to filter down our data in the Clause
