***Serial & Sequence
# we have already used the BIGSERIAL data type in our table.
# it is a special datatype which auto incriments a number.

# if we describe our person table,
-> \d  person;
# we can see that we have BIGINT datatype instead of BIGSERIAL.
# but the special thing is we have a sequence here,
nextval('person_id_seq'::regclass)

# letest select this sequence,
-> SELECT * FROM person_id_seq;

# we can see the last_value ue is 3 meaning the last id of person table is 3, 
# log_cnt is 30 and is_callable is t meaning TRUE.

# we can also call the nextval function.
-> SELECT nextval('person_id_seq'::regclass);
# we can see that the next value is 4.
# if we run that again, we can see it is 5, then 6 7......
# it is simmilar to next() function of python.

# now if we select the sequence again,
-> SELECT * FROM person_id_seq;
# we can see that the last_value  is 7

# this means though there are 3 people, the next person who will be inserted in this table will have an id of 8.
# because we have called the nextval() function several times.
# so lets try that,
-> insert into person (
    first_name, 
    last_name, 
    gender, 
    date_of_birth, 
    email, 
    country_of_birth
) 
values ('Sandro', 'Kalinke', 'Male', '2020-02-19', 'skalinkei@craigslist.org', 'Japan');

# now if we select all from person,
-> SELECT * FROM person;
# we can see that the new person have an id of 8.

# so sequences are simply BIGINT or INT depanding on whether we use BIGSERIAL or SERIAL.
SERIAL      <->     INT
BIGSERIAL   <->     BIGINT
# the difference between int and bigint is int requires 32 bit and bigint requires 64 bit.
# if we need to work with more data and have a good and fast server we should use bigint.
# otherwise, for small database int is a better option.

# we can also restart the actual value with the sequences.
# for doing that lets call the nextval() sevaral time.
-> SELECT nextval('person_id_seq'::regclass);
-> SELECT nextval('person_id_seq'::regclass);
-> SELECT nextval('person_id_seq'::regclass);
-> SELECT nextval('person_id_seq'::regclass);

# now if we select the sequence.
-> SELECT * FROM person_id_seq;

# now we can see that the last_value is 13.
# but as our original last vallue was 8, we want to restart the counting from 9.
# for restarting,
-> ALTER SEQUENCE person_id_seq RESTART WITH 9;

# now if we select the sequence,
-> SELECT * FROM person_id_seq;
# we can see that the last_value is 9.

# now if we add another person in this table,
-> insert into person (
    first_name, 
    last_name, 
    gender, 
    date_of_birth, 
    email, 
    country_of_birth
) 
values ('Ashia', 'McCourtie', 'Female', '2020-01-07', 'amccourties@spotify.com', 'China');

# and select all from person,
-> SELECT * FROM person;

# we can see that we successfully restarted the sequence.
