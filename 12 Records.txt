***Adding records
# we have seen it earlier.



***Delete Records
# in most cases, we will use the primary keys in the where clause to delete records.
-> delete everything            -> DELETE FROM person; [very careful]
-> delete the first record      -> DELETE FROM person WHERE id = '1';
-> delete all female of poland  -> DELETE FROM person WHERE gender = 'Female' AND country_of_birth = 'Poland';



***Update Records
# lets say we want to update ones nullable email to actual email.
-> updating all email           -> UPDATE person SET email = 'Sydneyley@gmail.com';
-> updating specific email      -> UPDATE person SET email = 'Sydneyley@gmail.com' WHERE id = 2;
-> updating multiple columns    -> UPDATE person SET first_name = 'Mr.Syd', last_name = 'Prank' WHERE id = 2;

[Be careful when we delete or update records we must use WHERE clause]
