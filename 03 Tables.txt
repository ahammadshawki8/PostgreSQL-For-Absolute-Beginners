***Create
# we need to write this command

CREATE TABLE table_name (
	Column_name  data_type  constraints_if_any
);


# if we represent people in our database we will have

 CREATE TABLE person (
 	id INT,
	first_name VARCHAR(50),
	last_name VARCHAR(50),
	gender VARCHAR(6),
	date_of_birth DATE
);

# INT -> intergers
# VARCHAR(max_length) -> strings 
# TIMESTAMP -> full date (including hour-minutes-seconds)
# DATE -> full date (excluding hour-minutes-seconds)

# all datatypes in postgres

***Creating Tables Without Constraints
-> to see all the tables in a database -> \d 
\d means describe
-> to see all the columns in a table -> \d table_name
-> to see extended informations about a table -> \d+ table_name


***Creating table with constraints
user should satisfy this constraints in order to put data in this table,
CREATE TABLE person (
 	id BIGSERIAL NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
	first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
	last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
	gender VARCHAR(6) NOT NULL,
	date_of_birth DATE NOT NULL,
	email VARCHAR(32) 
);

# They can't be NULL
# BIGSERIAL datatype incriment by itself
# and the id is the PRIMARY KEY of this table
# meaning it uniquely identify a person

# Now if we use \d command to see the realtions,
# we can see that we have a sequence here which is for the BIGSERIAL
# if we want to only see the tables, not the sequence,
# then we can use \dt command

***Delete
-> deleting tables -> DROP TABLE table_name;

NOTE: very carefull



# Extra Tips
# We can create unlogged tables so that we can make the tables considerably faster. 
# Unlogged table skips writing WRITE-ahead log 
# which means it's not crash-safe and unable to replicate.

CREATE UNLOGGED TABLE person ( 
	person_id BIGINT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, 
	last_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, 
	first_name VARCHAR(255), 
	address VARCHAR(255), 
	city VARCHAR(255)
);
