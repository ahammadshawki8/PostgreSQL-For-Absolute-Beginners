***Basics
# addition
-> SELECT 10 + 7;

# substraction
-> SELECT 10 - 7;

# multiplication
-> SELECT 10 * 7;

# floor division
-> SELECT 10 / 7;

# Power 
-> SELECT 2 ^ 10;

# Modulo
-> SELECT 10 % 7;

# Factorial
-> SELECT 5!;

# combining operations
-> SELECT 10 * 2 - 8;
# BODMAS/PEMDAS

# using the brackets
-> SELECT 10 * (2 - 8);
-> SELECT 10 * (2 + (8 + 7 * 6));



*** ROUND
# lets say we want to display a discount price column using a query
-> SELECT id, make, model, price, (price * 0.1) FROM car; 
# lets round the discount
-> SELECT id, make, model, price, ROUND((price * 0.1), 2) FROM car; 
# now we want to add a column with final price after discount,
-> SELECT id, make, model, price, ROUND((price * 0.1), 2), price - ROUND((price * 0.1), 2) FROM car; 

# we can see that the column names are not correct
# by default, if we dont use the column anme postgres will use the actual function name as the column name,
# if we don't use any function, then postgres will use ?column?


*** Alias
# Alias is used for overriding any column name
-> SELECT id, make, model, price AS original_price, ROUND((price * 0.1), 2) AS discount, price - ROUND((price * 0.1), 2) AS discounted_price FROM car;
