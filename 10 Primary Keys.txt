***Primary_Key
# we ca use differnt data types for unique primary keys, 
# But for now BIGSERIAL will work.

-> describing the table -> \d person;
# we can see that we have "person_pkey" PRIMARY KEY, btree (id) as a primary key.

-> printing the first line -> SELECT * FROM person LIMIT 1;
# we can see that we have a person in our first row with id 1 as the primary key.

# lets add another person with the same id
-> INSERT INTO person (
    id,
	first_name,
	last_name,
	gender,
	date_of_birth,
	email,
    country_of_birth
)
VALUES (1, 'Fake', 'Account', 'Male', '2020-03-01', 'fakeaccount@blacknet.boom', 'RUSSIA');

# we can see that we are getting an error.
ERROR:  duplicate key value violates unique constraint "person_pkey"
DETAIL:  Key (id)=(1) already exists.
# That means we cant insert two rows with a single primary key in a database.

# What if we want to drop that unique constraint "person_pkey"?
# we can do that by altering the table
-> ALTER TABLE person DROP CONSTRAINT person_pkey;

# now if we describe the table again
-> \d person;
# we can see that there is no primary key iin that table

# now if we insert the previous row again,
-> INSERT INTO person (
    id,
	first_name,
	last_name,
	gender,
	date_of_birth,
	email,
    country_of_birth
)
VALUES (1, 'Fake', 'Account', 'Male', '2020-03-01', 'fakeaccount@blacknet.boom', 'RUSSIA');

# Now if we print the person row who have 1 id?
-> SELECT * FROM person WHERE id = 1;



***Adding Primary keys
# lets add the primary key back,
-> ALTER TABLE person ADD PRIMARY KEY (id);
# here we only need the id as the primary key, so we used that.
# but we can add more columns as the primary key.

# here we are getting an error
ERROR:  could not create unique index "person_pkey"
DETAIL:  Key (id)=(1) is duplicated.
# This is because we cannot add that column to the primary key which don't have unique values.

# to fix this we need to delete one record(row)
-> DELETE FROM person WHERE first_name = 'Fake';

# Now if we try that again,
-> ALTER TABLE person ADD PRIMARY KEY (id);

# and if we describe the table,
-> \d person;

# we can see that we have the primary key and the unique constraint 'person_pkey'.
