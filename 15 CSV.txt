***Exporting Query Results to CSV
# now we will see how to generatea csv with postgres.

# first we will create a query by selecting data from our table. 
-> SELECT * FROM person LEFT JOIN car ON person.car_id = car.id ORDER by person.id;

# we can now copy the results and paste it in a specific format.
-> \copy (SELECT * FROM person LEFT JOIN car ON person.car_id = car.id ORDER by person.id) TO 'F:/Study_Work/Python/Python WorkSpace/17. PostgreSQL/# Created Files/results.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER; 

# Note that all the command should be in one line and  we need to use / for directory path.
# here TO is used for the location we need to paste our query results,
# Delimeter ',' means it will be a comma seprated file.
# CSV is the file format
# HEADER means we want to include headers

# now lets open the csv file.
# we can see we have successfully created that csv file.
# this is how we can generate csv file from postgres.
